*Future changes in government policies in the PRC and the Greater Bay Area could materially and adversely affect the business, results of operations and prospects of China Merchants Commercial REIT
*The Properties are all located in Shekou, Shenzhen, which is part of the Greater Bay Area. The PRC Government has issued a succession of policies to promote the development of the Greater Bay Area, including policies to support scientific and technological innovation, infrastructure construction, modern industry development, financial services, residence and travel. The policy to support the Greater Bay Area's development is one of the national core strategies of the PRC and is expected to bring great development potential for China Merchants Commercial REIT. However, if the PRC Government's Greater Bay Area initiative is revised or cancelled, the development of the Greater Bay Area may slow down or come to a halt, thereby materially and adversely affecting the business, results of operations and prospects of China Merchants Commercial REIT.
*The Properties are all located in Shekou, which exposes China Merchants Commercial REIT to economic and property market conditions in Shekou and the PRC
*The Properties are all located in Shekou, which exposes China Merchants Commercial REIT to the risk of a downturn in economic and property market conditions in Shekou. The value of the Properties may be adversely affected by a number of local property market conditions, such as oversupply of commercial properties, the performance of other competing commercial properties and reduced demand for commercial space.
*China Merchants Commercial REIT's business and financial conditions and results of operations also depend, to a large extent, on the performance of the economy of Shenzhen and of the PRC. An economic downturn or a downturn in the property market in Shenzhen or the PRC could adversely affect China Merchants Commercial REIT.
